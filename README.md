# Mandelbrot_Set_Visualizer

Visualizes the M-Set Fractal. Can zoom into any part of the set, just click wherever! Very slow execution; you may think it's frozen but it can take about 30 seconds to process. According to my calculations, **1000** calculations per pixel processed.

Complexity: O(W*H*I) ...where ***W*H*** = *pixels processed,*  ***I*** = *number of iterations per pixel*
